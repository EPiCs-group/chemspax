# ChemSpaX

ChemSpaX can be used for local chemical space exploration of any structure.
This is done by placing substuents on a skeleton.
Two approaches were considered: 
  1) From a library of existing substituents choose a substituent and 
  attach it the skeleton.
  See attach_substituent.py.
  2) The user inputs an atom to be functionalized on a skeleton complex, 
  then a tetrahedron is formed around this atom and this atom can be replaced. 
  See generate_tetrahedron.py. **This approach is outdated and not maintained**

## Installation
Python 3.6.0 or higher is recommended. 

```
git clone https://github.com/EPiCs-group/chemspax
``` 

It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Anaconda can be used to manage virtual environments (**using Anaconda allows the user to skip 
compilation of openbabel from source**):  
     Download the latest installer from 
     [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).    
     For example: 
   ``` 
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
   
   Then run the installation script with: 
   ```
     bash Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh  
   ```
   The installation is pretty self explanatory, afterwards the following commands can be used to 
   create a virtual environment and activate it.  
The environment will be named 'chemspax', the conda_env.yml file can be changed if a different name is required. 
        
  ```
  conda env create -f conda_env.yml
  
  conda activate chemspax
  ```
  Check if the environment is installed correctly by running 
  ```
  conda env list
  ```
   
  More information on virtual environments can be found at the
  [venv homepage](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or 
  [this Anaconda cheatsheet](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)
## Instructions
First, we need to prepare the xyz file of the skeleton to which we want to attach a substituent.
An example .xyz file of a skeleton in the skeletons/ folder looks like this: 
![example](../images/example_functionalization_list.jpg)
    
In the functionalization_list each item is a functionalization. In the example figure shown below, 
4 functionalizations are done.   
The first item of each list (red circle) is the index of the atom_to_be_functionalized (the atom that will 
be replaced by the substituent).  
  
  
**Since commit [bf59491](https://github.com/EPiCs-group/chemspax/commit/bf59491b619c5064c1314848e2d4d8eb31e7d71d) all hydrogens are functionalized (used as atom_to_be_functionalized)
if no functionalization_list is given in the skeleton's xyz file (second line is empty). This preparation step can thus be skipped if 
the whole structure needs to be functionalized instead of specific indices.**  

Make sure to put no spaces in this functionalization_list. Since 
`sys.argv()` is used in the main.py files, each space might be interpreted as a new argument
to the function. Also note that index 0 is the **first atom in the xyz file**.
In the example figure above, the index of Ru = 0.  
![example](../images/example_atom_to_be_functionalized.jpg)
  
  The second item of each list (green circle) is the index of the bonded_atom, this is the 
  skeleton's atom that will be bonded to the substituent. 
  
  ![example](../images/example_bonded_atom.jpg)
  
  
  With these instructions the user should be able to 
  write the functionalization_list of the skeletons correctly to 
  the skeleton's xyz file and this skeleton's xyz file should be 
  moved to the  skeletons/ folder (**note: there should be no newline at the end of the xyz file!**).  
  To attach a substituent to this skeleton, an 
  explanation is given on how to proceed with the next 2 steps.  

  
  ### attach_substituent.py
  
  **Note: Make sure to check the relative path on line 175, 88, 66 
  and 21 are correctly set if you want to use attach_substituent.py directly.   
   It is recommended to keep everything as default and use the 
  functionalize_and_optimize_obabel.sh or 
  functionalize_and_optimize_xtb.sh scripts instead, which will be explained.**
  
  #### 1 Choosing from library/adding a substituent to library
  
  The user can upload manually generated substituents 
  to substituents_xyz/manually_generated/ or use the pre-made substituents
  contained in that folder.  
  
  ##### Use pre-made substituents
  
  * Move skeleton's xyz file to skeletons/ folder  
  * Run data_preparation.py
  * Go to step 2
  
  ##### (optional) Add new substituent
  
  I'll take the example of methyl (which is already in the substituents_xyz/manually_generated folder):  
  * Take an xyz file for (optimized) CH4, then remove one of the hydrogens, this is where the substituent will form a bond with the skeleton.  
  * Let the C (central atom of the
  substituent) be the first atom in the list of atoms in the xyz file. (by moving C to the third line of the xyz file) 
  * Save the xyz file in substituents_xyz/manually_generated 
  * Run data_preparation.py to be able to use this substituent for functionalizations
  * Go to step 2
  
  data_preparation.py is used to add the central atom and centroid vector per substituent to a .csv file 
  as these will be used to align the substituent with the skeleton. This script also manages to conversion between .mol and .xyz files.
  Note that it is recommended to provide .mol files when available, since these provide correct connectivity data for a structure.
  **data_preparation.py assumes that the central atom of the substituent (C in the case of CH3) is the first atom in the 
  .xyz file of the substituent and that the central atom of the substituent
  has a free electron pair such that a new bond can be formed!**  
  
  An example of the .csv file with information for each substituent 
  as generated by data_preparation.py is shown below:
  ![example](../images/example_csv_database.jpg)
  
  After correct preparation of the xyz/mol files for the skeleton and 
  (new) substituents and running data_preparation.py as explained above, 
  we can move on to the next step.  
  #### 2 Attaching substituent(s) to skeleton(s) 
  The user can use the 
  functionalize_and_optimize_obabel.sh or 
  functionalize_and_optimize_xtb.sh scripts to generate their functionalized complexes.
  In these scripts the $STARTING_C_SUBSTITUENT should be the first substituent to place on the skeleton, 
  the $RANDOM_C_SUBSTITUENTS should be a list of substituents that should be added after that. 
  The amount of substituents should match the amount of functionalization sites specified in the
  xyz file of the skeleton.  
  For example, if the user would like to place 4 methyl groups on a skeleton (as defined in the example skeleton xyz file in the pictures above)
  and optimize each functionalization with
  FF, functionalize_and_optimize_obabel.sh needs to be edited to:
  
  ```
  # select 1 random substituent with C as central atom as starting point
  STARTING_C_SUBSTITUENT="CH3"
  # select 3 random substituents with C as central atom
  RANDOM_C_SUBSTITUENTS="CH3 CH3 CH3"
  ```
  After this edit the script can be run: 
  ```
  bash functionalize_and_optimize_obabel.sh C
  ```
  
  If the STARTING_C_SUBSTITUENT and RANDOM_C_SUBSTITUENT variables are not modified, the C argument means that 6 random carbon substituents 
  will be placed. Similarly, the P argument will call the functionalize_skeletons_P_substituents function and 6 random phosphorus substituents will 
  be placed on the indicated sites of the skeleton. **The P and CP arguments have not been tested as thoroughly as the C argument**.  
  
  In the example shown here, 4 xyz and 4 .mol files in substituents_xyz/automatically_generated should be generated,
  one for each functionalized structure. The .mol files contain the correcly optimized functionalized structures.  
  This workflow is similar if the user would like to optimize 
  every functionalized skeleton with xTB, but then the functionalize_and_optimize_xtb.sh 
  script should be edited and used.
  #### Done
  
  More information for devs:  
  The Complex.generate_substituent_and_write_xyz()
  function from attach_substituent.py is used to functionalize a skeleton. The main_attach_substituent.py takes the following
  input:
  1) path_to_source_file
  2) target_name (**Note: name only, the file will always be placed in 
  substituents_xyz/automatically_generated with extension .xyz**)
  3) name of substituent group (same as key in .csv database)
  4) relative path to .csv database file
  5) bond length between central atom of the substituent and bonded_atom of skeleton 
  6) (Not used currently) whether the user wants to use the python script with the xtb bash script, in the 
  xtb bash script the conversion of the optimized .mol file to .xyz file doesn't happen in python.
  If this is set to false only ff optimization will be done and the python script will handle file conversions.
  
  Where each input value is given as a space delimited system argument.
  The user can modify the example of attach_substituent_folder/run.sh
  to their needs or use attach_substituent.py directly.
  
  **(outdated) generate_tetrahedron.py**
  
  **Note: Make sure to check the relative path on line 124 
  is correctly set, relatively to your working directory. This 
  script is not actively used anymore, it is recommended to use the approach
  described under attach_substituent.py.**
  
To functionalize a skeleton using this approach, now the bond lengths
between bonded_atom and central_atom of substituent and 
surrounding atoms of the substituent with central_atom of substituent is needed.
The main_generate_tetrahedron.py takes input values as follows:
  
  1) path_to_source_file
  2) target_name (**Note: name only, the file will always be placed in 
  substituents_xyz/automatically_generated with extension .xyz**)      
  3) bond length of new central atom of substituent with bonded_atom
  4) actual new central atom of substituent 
  5) bond length of new central atom of substituent with first surrounding
  substituent atom
  6) actual first surrounding substituent atom
  7) same as 5) for second surrounding substituent atom
  8) same as 6) for second surrounding substituent atom
  9) same as 5) for third surrounding substituent atom
  10) same as 6) for third surrounding substituent atom
  
  Where each input value is given as a space delimited system argument.
  The user can modify the example of generate_tetrahedron_folder/run.sh
  to their needs or use generate_tetrahedron.py directly.
  
## (outdated) Example usage of python scripts only
  - ```bash generate_tetrahedron_folder/run.sh``` to functionalize a RuPNP skeleton where 4 H sites 
  will be substituted for methyl groups using generate_tetrahedron.py
  - ```bash attach_substituent_folder/run.sh``` to functionalize a RuPNP skeleton where
  6 sites will be functionalized with substituents
